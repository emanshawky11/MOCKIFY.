# MOCKIFY

## Project Idea
Mockups are digital images that show how products will look before production.  
They help brands and designers present their products online in a professional, attractive, and customizable way without the cost of real production or photoshoots.  

**MOCKIFY** is not only a mockup platform, but also a **brand** that empowers users to create and personalize their own designs.  
It allows customers to **choose their design and preview it before printing**, making the process more flexible, efficient, and cost-effective.
